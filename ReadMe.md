# **Bayes_Classifier**

Developed a Bayes classifier with Gaussian class conditional densities to
classify two datasets, each having 3 classes

## Libraries Used
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib.pyplot
4. sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split

## Description
- This project was made as a part of an assignment of the course **CS669** **Pattern Recognition**.
- Bayes Classifier was implemented from scratch, where parameter for the classifier was estimated using **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**.
- **Decision boundaries** for both *linearly and non-linearly separable* test data was plotted.
